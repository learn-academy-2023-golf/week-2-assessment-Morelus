# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Your answer: Parameter is special variables that accept an input in a function and an argument is the value assigned in the parameter.  

Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder variable that is defined inside the parentheses of the function expression. An argument is the actual content passed to the function inside the parentheses of the function invocation.

Your answer:
Class if the blueprint for an object and an object is the intersection of data and behavior.

Researched answer:
Repeating a process a particular number of times or until a condition is met.
